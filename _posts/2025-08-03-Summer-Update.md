Haven't done very much on here—SpaceX constitutes a greater portion of my life than I think I'm willing to admit.

I've really enjoyed what I've done this summer and am happy I'm staying till September.

The most interesting thing I've learned about the company has been from events with the CEO and CFO. The company is undeniably directed toward reaching Mars — things like Starlink feel like "simple" (hehe) intermediate steps. SpaceX doesn't like money for money's sake — it's really an "in-game currency" to enable the Mars mission. I sound ridiculous since it is both visibly true externally and internally, but for whatever reason, I suspected an ulterior motive somewhere in there.

I've definitely taken the Mars pill and have adopted the SpaceX attitude. I think once the AI hype wave runs its course, the space industry will be next. AI or space: pick your poison.

Other than work, I've had to move three separate times with an additional and final move approaching. I've been living out of cardboard boxes and have been simulating the SF founder mode experience. Fortunately, since I'm in Hawthorne for more than half the week's hours, I go home, sleep, then immediately leave in the morning.

Anyhow, I miss London and Europe. I talked a lot of trash about London, but that was a time. Great city, even though the food is a challenge. Definitely miss Paris.

I went to Mexico City on July 4th and witnessed the anti-gentrification/digital nomad protests. Going to SF and NYC relatively soon.

Excited for senior year to start but have a feeling I'm going to wonder why I'm doing it. I feel like USC doesn't inspire me to build/learn/risk-take like LSE did. I'll have to find that motivation in a new project. Otherwise, looking forward to taking interesting math courses and fluffy GPA booster classes with non-math people.

There's your update, you invisible crowd of stalkers.
