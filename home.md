I'm a student at the **University of Southern California** and the **London School of Economics** studying Applied and Computational Mathematics with a focus on data science, computer science, and finance. I spent my full junior year at LSE in the math department so I partially claim it.

I enjoy math and computer science but I them as a framework to understand other topics. This has assisted me as I've started to gain experience in SaaS, finance, and the space/satelite industry.

My career goals are:
- Continue at SpaceX working on their LEO satelite constellation Starlink 
- Learn as much as I can about AI and gain experience

When prompted, ChatGPT has this to say about me: "He has a soft spot for messy datasets, weirdly specific questions, and turning overthinking into a marketable skill. He builds things, analyzses stuff, and occasionally makes sense."
