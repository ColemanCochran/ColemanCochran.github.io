I'm a student at the **University of Southern California** and the **London School of Economics** studying Applied and Computational Mathematics with a focus on data science, computer science, and finance. (I spent my full junior year at LSE in the math department so I partially claim it)

I enjoy math and computer science but I use them as a framework/background to understand other topics. This has primarily assisted me as I've started to gain experience in SaaS, business, and the economy of space.

ChatGPT describes me as: "He has a soft spot for messy datasets, weirdly specific questions, and turning overthinking into a marketable skill. He builds things, analyzse stuff, and occasionally make sense."
