I'm a student at the **University of Southern California** and the **London School of Economics** studying Applied and Computational Mathematics with a focus on data science and computer science. I spent my full junior year at LSE in the math department so I partially claim it.

I like math/cs but I use them as a framework to understand other topics - I don't think I could ever be a developer. This has assisted me as I've started to gain experience and explore topics in SaaS, finance, and the space industry.

When prompted, ChatGPT has this to say about me: "He has a soft spot for messy datasets, weirdly specific questions, and turning overthinking into a marketable skill. He builds things, analyzses stuff, and occasionally makes sense."
